Hospitals deal with multiple moving parts — patients, doctors, surgeries, billing, tests, rooms, medicines.  
This dashboard helps answer crucial questions like:

- How many patients were admitted/discharged today?
- Which doctor has the most appointments?
- Which medicines are running low?
- Are any clinical test results abnormal?
- What is the overall revenue trend?

The aim is to bring **clarity, efficiency, and actionable insights** for better decision-making.
